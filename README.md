# C-GameEngine
A Game Engine and Game produced in C++.  Running the game requires DirectX9 to be installed.

To Run the Game, place all code and images into a single file named GameEngine. Ensure that DirectX9 (Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)) is in your program files. 
Game Code.c++ contains the initializing and game loop.

Some code was provided by my tutor Chris Rook.
